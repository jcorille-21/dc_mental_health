## Introduction

My favorite memories of my childhood include experiencing life with my brother and friends. My brother, friends and
I would always go outside to play football, then go back to indulge in video games and spend the rest of our night
arguing over who would win. These little experiences taught me the value of family and friends. Fast forward to today,
and those experiences are long gone. My friends all moved out going down their own separate paths. But worst of all,
my brother was recently diagnosed with ADHD. He is suffering from this condition and is having trouble studying and
focusing, which causes him to lose his appetite and struggle with daily activities in life. I cannot bear to see
someone so important to me being consumed by a mental health condition.

The project I am reviewing is an article called *Don’t Cut DC’S Lifeline to Mental Health*, by the District of
Columbia Health Matters Collaborative. My short anecdote proves the importance of mental health and how I believe
it needs to be addressed in many other projects. According to the project, the DC Health Matters Collaborative was
created in 2012, and houses hospitals in the District of Columbia. The project was created to advocate for avoiding
cuts to the budgets of various healthcare providers in Washington DC. There is also a need to prioritize the mental
health of the residents of DC. The goal of this project is to create a call to action and give equitable access to
mental health. The intended audience appears to be pointed toward healthcare authorities and the higher-ups of Washington
DC, because of the call to action provided in the project. The project is very educational as well, so anyone who wants
to learn more about mental health in Washington DC would benefit from this project as well.
